# OSCalc

OSCalc is an open source calculator library demonstrating how to organize an open source
JavaScript project. The library is for demonstration purposes only and is not actually meant to be
used in a production application.

You can follow along the development of this library on the [Gun.io blog](https://gun.io/blog/).

__Note: OSCalc is currently not available to be downloaded since it does not yet exist. These
instructions are just for demonstration purposes at the moment.__
